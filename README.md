# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Portfolio using Responsive Formatting for Different Screen Sizes
Built grid from scratch using Bootstrap 4. Place holder page in place for projects.
Makind images compliant with html5 requires using px for width and height which makes
more of a challenge. Formerly could use % for width and height which made it easier
to create smooth transitions.
